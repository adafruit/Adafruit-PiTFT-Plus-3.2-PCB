Is this not the cutest little display for the Raspberry Pi? It features a 3.2" display with 320x240 16-bit color pixels and a resistive touch overlay. The plate uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top!

This design fits perfectly onto the Pi Zero, Pi 3, Pi 2 or Model A+, B+! (Any Pi with a 2x20 connector) Not for use with an old Pi 1 with 2x13 connector. This display is functionally the same as our classic PiTFT 2.8" and PiTFT Plus 2.8" - same pins used, same resolution, same drivers, but is just a bit bigger. It also has a 26- pins GPIO pins brought out so you can connect a 26-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO cable underneath. It's the same outline as a Pi 3 / 2 / B+ so it fits well on top of a Pi in our Raspberry Pi Enclosure base.
